# The Not Shark App

You know those days where you see something on your walk, or maybe you're browsing something online and you just want to know whether it's a shark? Well, we've got you covered. Our little app uses a Tensorflow Lite classifier that allows to point your camera at an object, and tell you whether said object is a shark or not!

The flutter app along with the final model resides in this repository, while you can find the code used to train the model [here](https://github.com/manavpatnaik/shark-classifier).

Inspired by the Not Hotdog App from the Silicon Valley TV series.
